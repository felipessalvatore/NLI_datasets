What occurs when electron clouds overlap from different atoms?,"When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.:93 The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object.",entailment

In what way do idea strings transmit tesion forces?,"Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.",entailment
In what way do idea strings transmit tesion forces?,"However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load.",not_entailment
What does matter actually have that Newtonian mechanics doesn't address?,"However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object.",entailment
What does matter actually have that Newtonian mechanics doesn't address?,Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects.,not_entailment
Where does centripetal force go?,This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path.,entailment
